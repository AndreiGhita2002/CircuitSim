# CircuitSim

CircuitSim is a basic circuit and electronics simulation I'm making part of the IB Computer Science HL course. The goal is to make a small and easy to use app that allows you to build and test some simple electronic circuits.

Features:
- checking whenever or not a circuit is closed
- calculating current
- simulating DC current
- simple interface
