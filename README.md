# CircuitSim

CircuitSim is a basic circuit and electronics simulation I'm making part of the IB Computer Science HL course. The goal is to make a small and easy to use app that allows you to build and test some simple electronic circuits.

### Features:
- solving a DC circuit with any number of components, using Kirchhoff's circuit laws
- basic interfaced
- saving and loading circuits

### External Libraries used:
- javafx 11.0
- Jama 1.0.3
- jgrapht 1.5.0
